## Build **[游깷 IPv4resolver](https://github.com/Makana-Grey/FloppyCats/tree/master/IPv4resolver)**

It's first project that you need to build. It's uses in game as **STATIC** library.  
Use [游댱游댳驕勇뀩oost.Asio游댱游댳驕勇끃(https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) for define IPv4 by host name.

In [definition.hpp](https://github.com/Makana-Grey/FloppyCats/blob/master/FloppyCatsOnline/FloppyCatsOnline/definitions.hpp) API point set to *http://localhost:3000*  
Config set up to watch on *IPv4resolver/Debug* and *IPv4resolver/Release* to use [IPv4resolver](https://github.com/Makana-Grey/FloppyCats/tree/master/IPv4resolver)  
  
For static files like media and other data is set up [Post-Build hooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-specify-build-events-csharp?view=vs-2022) that use standart Windows CMD commands to copy this files to output dirs.
