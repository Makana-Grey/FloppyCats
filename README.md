Config set up to watch on *IPv4resolver/Debug* and *IPv4resolver/Release* to use [IPv4resolver](https://github.com/Makana-Grey/FloppyCats/tree/master/IPv4resolver)  
  
For static files like media and other data is set up [Post-Build hooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-specify-build-events-csharp?view=vs-2022) that use standart Windows CMD commands to copy this files to output dirs.
